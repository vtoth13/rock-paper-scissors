## Game Rules

Objective: The objective of Rock, Paper, and Scissors is to defeat your opponent by choosing an item that beats their chosen item.


### Items:
- Rock: Represented by a closed fist, rock crushes scissors.
- Paper: Represented by an open hand, paper covers rock.
- Scissors: Represented by a fist with the index and middle finger extended, scissors cut paper.

### Winning and Losing
1. Rock crushes scissors, so if you choose a rock and your opponent chooses scissors, you win.
2. Paper covers rock, so if you choose paper and your opponent chooses rock, you win.
3. Scissors cut paper, so if you choose scissors and your opponent chooses paper, you win.
#### Ties: If both players choose the same item, the game is a tie, and it is usually played again to determine the winner.

## Bugs
### Solved bugs
- The function to close the popup with the "Esc" button didn't seem to work when I tried to identify the key as "Esc"
    - Solution: I used the KeyCode instead ```keyCode === 27```

- The player was able to Enter an empty name in the prompt
    - Solution: ``` if (!playerName || playerName.trim() === "") {``` This condition checks if playerName is falsy (which includes null, undefined, an empty string, etc.) or if playerName consists of only whitespace characters after trimming it.

### Unsolved Bugs
- None
